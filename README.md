# Princeton-ADS
Companion to Princeton's 6 week Algorithms and Data Structures course. Throughout the course I'll provide brief notes on what is being discussed and well as my solutions to the problems. 

## Usage
With each week comes a programming assignment in Java. 

Most of the assignments require you to import methods from the Princeton algs4.jar library. To do so you can either configure your IDE's classpath or manually select the classpath each time you run the program.

Since I chose the latter, I'll provide an example where the user is compiling RandomWord.java. In the command line type:
```
javac -cp ../algs4.jar RandomWord.java
```
